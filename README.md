## Why Testcontainers?
Testcontainers [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) is a library providing Docker based container instances for testing.
Testcontainers is available for several technology stacks:

* Java
* Dotnet
* Node
* Go

and more. Support for a broad range of testing frameworks is available as well.

## NestJS and Testcontainers
NestJS is one of the most advanced frameworks when it comes to develop backend applications on Node. Although the number resources
providing examples for NestJS combined with Testcontainers are quite limited.
The example project would like to fill the gap.
